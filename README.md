## 论文名称：
A Optimal Power Proưles of Bicycle Time Trial
## 内容介绍：
We develop a model that can be applied to any type of rider that determines the
relationship between the rider’s position on the course and the power the rider applies. The rider has a
limit on the total energy that can be expended over the course, as well as limits that accumulate from
past aggressiveness and for exceeding the power curve limits.
## 技术介绍：
monte-carlo simulation; mathematical and physical modeling for power proưles of two
types of riders
